# üìê schematic

schematic is a library for data validation and transformation.

## Example

```elixir
import Schematic

schematic =
  schema(S1, %{
    {"foo", :foo} => oneof([str(), int()]),
    bar:
      schema(S2, %{
        {"alice", :alice} => str("Alice"),
        {"bob", :bob} => list(str()),
        {"carol", :carol} =>
          schema(S3, %{
            {"baz", :baz} =>
              oneof([
                schema(S4, %{one: int()}),
                schema(S5, %{two: str()})
              ])
          })
      })
  })

input = %{
  "foo" => "hi there!",
  "bar" => %{
    "alice" => "Alice",
    "bob" => ["is", "the", "coolest"],
    "carol" => %{
      "baz" => %{
        "two" => "the second"
      }
    }
  }
}

assimilate(schematic, input)

# returns...

{:ok,
  %S1{
    foo: "hi there!",
    bar: %S2{
      alice: "Alice",
      bob: ["is", "the", "coolest"],
      carol: %S3{
        baz: %S5{
          two: "the second"
        }
      }
    }
